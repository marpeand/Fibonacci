# Fibonacci Python :snake: Bot :robot:
## Implementing Tweepy


In mathematics, the Fibonacci sequence or series is the following infinite sequence of natural numbers:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21....

## Ecuation
The Fibonacci numbers are defined by the equation:

```
f0 = 0  
f1 = 1  
fn = fn-1 + fn-2
```

### This makes: 

```
f2 = 1  
f3 = 2  
f4 = 3  
f5 = 5  
f6 = 8  
f7 = 13  
.....
```


## Twitter problems

Currently twitter only allows 280 characters, with the passage of time, the fibonacci sequence will begin to be longer and longer and occupy more characters.
I calculate that when n = 1335 the length of Fn will be equivalent to 280 characters and that is when the bot will stop working, it will last approximately 500 days in operation
